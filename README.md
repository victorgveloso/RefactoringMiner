# How to build RefactoringMiner

In order to build the project, run `./gradlew jar` (or `gradlew jar`, in Windows) in the project's root directory.
Alternatively, you can generate a complete distribution zip including all runtime dependencies running `./gradlew distZip`.

You can also work with the project with Eclipse IDE. First, run `./gradlew eclipse` to generate Eclipse project metadata files. Then, import it into Eclipse using the *Import Existing Project* feature.

# How to use RefactoringMiner as a maven dependency

Since version 2.0, RefactoringMiner is available in the [Maven Central Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.tsantalis/refactoring-miner).
In order to use RefactoringMiner as a maven dependency in your project, add the following snippet to your project's build configuration file:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.tsantalis</groupId>
      <artifactId>refactoring-miner</artifactId>
      <version>2.1.0</version>
    </dependency>

# Chrome Extension
If you want to get refactoring information when inspecting a commit on GitHub,
you can install our [Refactoring Aware Commit Review](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refactoring-aware-commit/lnloiaibmonmmpnfibfjjlfcddoppmgd) Chrome Extension.

The Chrome extension can detect refactorings for **public** projects and commits matching the following URL patterns:
* `https://github.com/user/project/commit/id`
* `https://github.com/user/project/pull/id/commits/id`

# API usage guidelines
## With a locally cloned git repository
RefactoringMiner can automatically detect refactorings in the entire history of 
git repositories, between specified commits or tags, or at specified commits.

In the code snippet below we demonstrate how to print all refactorings performed
in the toy project https://github.com/danilofes/refactoring-toy-example.git.

```java
GitService gitService = new GitServiceImpl();
GitHistoryRefactoringMiner miner = new GitHistoryRefactoringMinerImpl();

Repository repo = gitService.cloneIfNotExists(
    "tmp/refactoring-toy-example",
    "https://github.com/danilofes/refactoring-toy-example.git");

miner.detectAll(repo, "master", new RefactoringHandler() {
  @Override
  public void handle(String commitId, List<Refactoring> refactorings) {
    System.out.println("Refactorings at " + commitId);
    for (Refactoring ref : refactorings) {
      System.out.println(ref.toString());
    }
  }
});
```

You can also analyze between commits using `detectBetweenCommits` or between tags using `detectBetweenTags`. RefactoringMiner will iterate through all *non-merge* commits from **start** commit/tag to **end** commit/tag.

```java
// start commit: 819b202bfb09d4142dece04d4039f1708735019b
// end commit: d4bce13a443cf12da40a77c16c1e591f4f985b47
miner.detectBetweenCommits(repo, 
    "819b202bfb09d4142dece04d4039f1708735019b", "d4bce13a443cf12da40a77c16c1e591f4f985b47",
    new RefactoringHandler() {
  @Override
  public void handle(String commitId, List<Refactoring> refactorings) {
    System.out.println("Refactorings at " + commitId);
    for (Refactoring ref : refactorings) {
      System.out.println(ref.toString());
    }
  }
});
```

```java
// start tag: 1.0
// end tag: 1.1
miner.detectBetweenTags(repo, "1.0", "1.1", new RefactoringHandler() {
  @Override
  public void handle(String commitId, List<Refactoring> refactorings) {
    System.out.println("Refactorings at " + commitId);
    for (Refactoring ref : refactorings) {
      System.out.println(ref.toString());
    }
  }
});
```

It is possible to analyze a specifc commit using `detectAtCommit` instead of `detectAll`. The commit
is identified by its SHA key, such as in the example below:

```java
miner.detectAtCommit(repo, "05c1e773878bbacae64112f70964f4f2f7944398", new RefactoringHandler() {
  @Override
  public void handle(String commitId, List<Refactoring> refactorings) {
    System.out.println("Refactorings at " + commitId);
    for (Refactoring ref : refactorings) {
      System.out.println(ref.toString());
    }
  }
});
```
You can get the churn of a specific commit using `churnAtCommit` as follows:
```java
Churn churn = miner.churnAtCommit(repo, "05c1e773878bbacae64112f70964f4f2f7944398", handler);
```
## With two directories containing Java source code

There is also a lower level API that compares the Java files in two directories
containing the code before and after some changes:  

```java
UMLModel model1 = new UMLModelASTReader(new File("/path/to/version1")).getUmlModel();
UMLModel model2 = new UMLModelASTReader(new File("/path/to/version2")).getUmlModel();
UMLModelDiff modelDiff = model1.diff(model2);
List<Refactoring> refactorings = modelDiff.getRefactorings();
```
## With all information fetched directly from GitHub

To use this API, please provide a valid OAuth token in the `github-oauth.properties` file.
You can generate an OAuth token in GitHub `Settings` -> `Developer settings` -> `Personal access tokens`.

If you don't want to clone locally the repository, you can use the following code snippet:

```java
GitHistoryRefactoringMiner miner = new GitHistoryRefactoringMinerImpl();
miner.detectAtCommit("https://github.com/danilofes/refactoring-toy-example.git",
    "36287f7c3b09eff78395267a3ac0d7da067863fd", new RefactoringHandler() {
  @Override
  public void handle(String commitId, List<Refactoring> refactorings) {
    System.out.println("Refactorings at " + commitId);
    for (Refactoring ref : refactorings) {
      System.out.println(ref.toString());
    }
  }
}, 10);
```
If you want to analyze all commits of a pull request, you can use the following code snippet:

```java
GitHistoryRefactoringMiner miner = new GitHistoryRefactoringMinerImpl();
miner.detectAtPullRequest("https://github.com/apache/drill.git", 1807, new RefactoringHandler() {
  @Override
  public void handle(String commitId, List<Refactoring> refactorings) {
    System.out.println("Refactorings at " + commitId);
    for (Refactoring ref : refactorings) {
      System.out.println(ref.toString());
    }
  }
}, 10);
```

# Location information for the detected refactorings
All classes implementing the `Refactoring` interface include refactoring-specific location information.
For example, `ExtractOperationRefactoring` offers the following methods:

1. `getSourceOperationCodeRangeBeforeExtraction()` : Returns the code range of the source method in the **parent** commit
2. `getSourceOperationCodeRangeAfterExtraction()` : Returns the code range of the source method in the **child** commit
3. `getExtractedOperationCodeRange()` : Returns the code range of the extracted method in the **child** commit
4. `getExtractedCodeRangeFromSourceOperation()` : Returns the code range of the extracted code fragment from the source method in the **parent** commit
5. `getExtractedCodeRangeToExtractedOperation()` : Returns the code range of the extracted code fragment to the extracted method in the **child** commit
6. `getExtractedOperationInvocationCodeRange()` : Returns the code range of the invocation to the extracted method inside the source method in the **child** commit

Each method returns a `CodeRange` object including the following properties:
```java
String filePath
int startLine
int endLine
int startColumn
int endColumn
```
Alternatively, you can use the methods `List<CodeRange> leftSide()` and `List<CodeRange> rightSide()` to get a list of `CodeRange` objects for the left side (i.e., **parent** commit) and right side (i.e., **child** commit) of the refactoring, respectively.

# Statement matching information for the detected refactorings
All method-related refactoring (Extract/Inline/Move/Rename/ExtractAndMove Operation) objects come with a `UMLOperationBodyMapper` object, which can be obtained by calling method `getBodyMapper()` on the refactoring object.

Let's consider the Extract Method refactoring in commit [JetBrains/intellij-community@7ed3f27](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/commit/7ed3f273ab0caf0337c22f0b721d51829bb0c877)

![example|1665x820](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1483516/52974463-b0240000-338f-11e9-91e2-966f20be2514.png)

#1. You can use the following code snippet to obtain the **newly added statements** in the extracted method:
```java
ExtractOperationRefactoring refactoring = ...;
UMLOperationBodyMapper mapper = refactoring.getBodyMapper();
List<StatementObject> newLeaves = mapper.getNonMappedLeavesT2(); //newly added leaf statements
List<CompositeStatementObject> newComposites = mapper.getNonMappedInnerNodesT2(); //newly added composite statements
List<StatementObject> deletedLeaves = mapper.getNonMappedLeavesT1(); //deleted leaf statements
List<CompositeStatementObject> deletedComposites = mapper.getNonMappedInnerNodesT1(); //deleted composite statements
```
For the Extract Method Refactoring example shown above `mapper.getNonMappedLeavesT2()` returns the following statements:
```java
final String url = pageNumber == 0 ? "courses" : "courses?page=" + String.valueOf(pageNumber);
final CoursesContainer coursesContainer = getFromStepic(url,CoursesContainer.class);
return coursesContainer.meta.containsKey("has_next") && coursesContainer.meta.get("has_next") == Boolean.TRUE;
```
#2. You can use the following code snippet to obtain the **matched statements** between the original and the extracted methods:
```java
ExtractOperationRefactoring refactoring = ...;
UMLOperationBodyMapper mapper = refactoring.getBodyMapper();
for(AbstractCodeMapping mapping : mapper.getMappings()) {
  AbstractCodeFragment fragment1 = mapping.getFragment1();
  AbstractCodeFragment fragment2 = mapping.getFragment2();
  Set<Replacement> replacements = mapping.getReplacements();
  for(Replacement replacement : replacements) {
    String valueBefore = replacement.getBefore();
    String valueAfter = replacement.getAfter();
    ReplacementType type = replacement.getType();
  }
}
```
For the Extract Method Refactoring example shown above `mapping.getReplacements()` returns the following AST node replacement for the pair of matched statements:
```java
final List<CourseInfo> courseInfos = getFromStepic("courses",CoursesContainer.class).courses;
final List<CourseInfo> courseInfos = coursesContainer.courses;
```
**Replacement**: `getFromStepic("courses",CoursesContainer.class)` -> `coursesContainer`

**ReplacementType**: VARIABLE_REPLACED_WITH_METHOD_INVOCATION

#3. You can use the following code snippet to obtain the **overlapping refactorings** in the extracted method:
```java
ExtractOperationRefactoring refactoring = ...;
UMLOperationBodyMapper mapper = refactoring.getBodyMapper();
Set<Refactoring> overlappingRefactorings = mapper.getRefactorings();
```
For the Extract Method Refactoring example shown above `mapper.getRefactorings()` returns the following refactoring:

**Extract Variable** `coursesContainer : CoursesContainer` in method
`private addCoursesFromStepic(result List<CourseInfo>, pageNumber int) : boolean`
from class `com.jetbrains.edu.stepic.EduStepicConnector`

because variable `coursesContainer = getFromStepic(url,CoursesContainer.class)` has been extracted from the following statement of the original method by replacing string literal `"courses"` with variable `url`:
```java
final List<CourseInfo> courseInfos = getFromStepic("courses",CoursesContainer.class).courses;
```

# Running RefactoringMiner from the command line

When you build a distributable application with `./gradlew distZip`, you can run Refactoring Miner as a command line application. Extract the file under `build/distribution/RefactoringMiner.zip` in the desired location, and cd into the `bin` folder (or include it in your path). Then, run `RefactoringMiner -h` to show its usage:

    > RefactoringMiner -h

	-h											Show options
	-a <git-repo-folder> <branch> -json <path-to-json-file>					Detect all refactorings at <branch> for <git-repo-folder>. If <branch> is not specified, commits from all branches are analyzed.
	-bc <git-repo-folder> <start-commit-sha1> <end-commit-sha1> -json <path-to-json-file>	Detect refactorings between <start-commit-sha1> and <end-commit-sha1> for project <git-repo-folder>
	-bt <git-repo-folder> <start-tag> <end-tag> -json <path-to-json-file>			Detect refactorings between <start-tag> and <end-tag> for project <git-repo-folder>
	-c <git-repo-folder> <commit-sha1> -json <path-to-json-file>				Detect refactorings at specified commit <commit-sha1> for project <git-repo-folder>
	-gc <git-URL> <commit-sha1> <timeout> -json <path-to-json-file>				Detect refactorings at specified commit <commit-sha1> for project <git-URL> within the given <timeout> in seconds. All required information is obtained directly from GitHub using the OAuth token in github-oauth.properties
	-gp <git-URL> <pull-request> <timeout> -json <path-to-json-file>			Detect refactorings at specified pull request <pull-request> for project <git-URL> within the given <timeout> in seconds for each commit in the pull request. All required information is obtained directly from GitHub using the OAuth token in github-oauth.properties
	
With a locally cloned repository, run:

    > git clone https://github.com/danilofes/refactoring-toy-example.git refactoring-toy-example
    > ./RefactoringMiner -c refactoring-toy-example 36287f7c3b09eff78395267a3ac0d7da067863fd

If you don't want to clone locally the repository, run:

    > ./RefactoringMiner -gc https://github.com/danilofes/refactoring-toy-example.git 36287f7c3b09eff78395267a3ac0d7da067863fd 10

**For all options you can add the `-json <path-to-json-file>` command arguments to save the JSON output in a file. The results are appended to the file after each processed commit.**

For the `-gc` and `-gp` options you must provide a valid OAuth token in the `github-oauth.properties` file stored in the `bin` folder.
You can generate an OAuth token in GitHub `Settings` -> `Developer settings` -> `Personal access tokens`.

In both cases, you will get the output in JSON format:
